=== ADR-003: Technology Stack (Python/FastAPI)

*Status:* Accepted (2025-09-18)

*Context:*
A programming language and web framework are needed to build the MCP API Server. The choice must align with the need for rapid development, strong text-processing capabilities, and high performance for an I/O-bound application.

*Decision:*
The backend will be implemented in **Python**. The **FastAPI** framework will be used to build the web server and API endpoints.

*Consequences:*

* Python has an exceptional ecosystem for text processing and data manipulation.
* FastAPI provides high performance for I/O-bound tasks, data validation, and automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, which helps achieve USAB-1 and USAB-2.
* The large talent pool for Python simplifies maintenance.
* Python's GIL can be a limitation for CPU-bound tasks, but this application is primarily I/O-bound (reading files, network requests).
