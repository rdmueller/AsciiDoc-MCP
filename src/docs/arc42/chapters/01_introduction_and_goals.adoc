== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges when interacting with extensive documentation projects. The primary issues are:

*   **Token Limitations**: Large, single-file documents exceed the context window of most models.
*   **Lack of Structure Awareness**: LLMs cannot navigate or understand the hierarchical structure of a documentation project (e.g., chapters, sections).
*   **Inefficient Access**: Reading entire files is token-inefficient when only small sections are needed.
*   **Difficult Manipulation**: Modifying specific parts of a document is cumbersome and error-prone.

**dacli** (Documentation Access CLI) aims to solve these problems by providing structured, content-aware tools for interacting with AsciiDoc and Markdown projects. Available as both a CLI tool and MCP server, it enables efficient navigation, reading, and modification of complex documentation.

=== Quality Goals

The architecture will prioritize the following key quality goals, derived from the non-functional requirements:

.Top Quality Goals
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Goal | Description
| **Performance** | API calls for typical navigation and read operations must respond in under 2 seconds. Pre-processing during startup is acceptable.
| **Data Integrity & Reliability** | Changes to documents must be atomic. No data loss shall occur during file modifications, even in case of errors.
| **Usability** | The system must be fully compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure seamless integration for developers and architects.
| **Scalability** | The server must handle large documentation projects of up to 600 pages without significant performance degradation.

=== Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders of dacli are:

.Stakeholders
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Role/Name | Contact | Expectations
| **Software Developer** | Development Team | Uses dacli to analyze and maintain code documentation with LLM assistance.
| **Software Architect** | Architecture Team | Uses dacli to manage and update large-scale architecture documents (e.g., arc42) with LLMs.
| **Documentation Engineer** | Documentation Team | Manages complex documentation projects, relying on dacli for efficient navigation and maintenance.
