== Deployment View

This chapter describes the infrastructure and environment for the MCP Documentation Server.

=== Deployment Strategy

The application is designed to be lightweight and self-contained, in line with its constraints (no external services). The recommended deployment strategy is to package the Python application and its dependencies into a Docker container.

The Web Interface (SPA) is a set of static files (HTML, CSS, JS) that can be served by any web server or even directly by the FastAPI backend for simplicity.

=== Production Environment

The production environment is envisioned as a single virtual or physical machine running Docker.
