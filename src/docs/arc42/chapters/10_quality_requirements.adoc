== Quality Requirements

This chapter defines the most important quality requirements for the system. Each requirement is specified as a concrete, measurable scenario.

=== Performance

The system must provide fast access to documentation content, even in large projects.

.Performance Scenarios
[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Quality Goal | Scenario | Measurement
| PERF-1 | Response Time | When a user requests a typical section via `get_section`, the system shall return the content. | Response time < 2 seconds for a 10-page section within a 600-page project.
| PERF-2 | Indexing Time | When the server starts, it indexes the entire documentation project. | Initial indexing of a 600-page project completes in < 60 seconds.
| PERF-3 | Low Overhead | While the server is idle, it shall consume minimal system resources. | CPU usage < 5% and a stable, non-growing memory footprint.
|===

=== Reliability and Data Integrity

The system must be robust and guarantee that no data is lost or corrupted.

.Reliability Scenarios
[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Quality Goal | Scenario | Measurement
| REL-1 | Atomic Writes | When a user updates a section (`update_section`) and an error occurs mid-operation (e.g., disk full), the original file shall remain unmodified. | The file on disk is either the original version or the fully updated version, never a partially written or corrupted state. A backup/restore mechanism is used.
| REL-2 | Error Handling | When a user provides a malformed path to an API call (e.g., `get_section("invalid.path")`), the system shall return a descriptive error. | The API returns a structured error message (e.g., HTTP 400) with a clear explanation, without crashing the server.
| REL-3 | Data Integrity | After a series of 100 random but valid modification operations, the document structure remains valid and no content is lost. | A validation check (`validate_structure()`) run after the operations reports zero errors.
|===

=== Usability

The system must be easy to use for its target audience of developers and architects.

.Usability Scenarios
[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Quality Goal | Scenario | Measurement
| USAB-1 | MCP Compliance | A developer uses a standard MCP client to connect to the server and request the document structure. | The server responds with a valid structure as defined in the MCP specification, without requiring any custom client-side logic.
| USAB-2 | Intuitiveness | A developer can successfully perform the top 5 use cases (e.g., get section, update section, search) by only reading the API documentation. | 90% success rate in user testing with the target audience.
| USAB-3 | Feedback | When a section is modified via the web UI, the changes are immediately visible. | The UI displays a red/green diff of the changes within 1 second of the modification API call completing.
|===

=== Scalability

The system must be able to handle large documentation projects.

.Scalability Scenarios
[cols="1,1,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Quality Goal | Scenario | Measurement
| SCAL-1 | Project Size | The server processes a large documentation project composed of multiple files. | The system successfully indexes and handles a 600-page AsciiDoc project with response times still within the defined performance limits (PERF-1).
| SCAL-2 | Concurrent Access | While one client is reading a large section, a second client initiates a request to modify a different section. | Both operations complete successfully without deadlocks or data corruption. The modification is correctly applied.
