== Solution Strategy

This chapter outlines the fundamental architectural decisions and strategies to meet the requirements defined in the previous chapters.

=== Core Architectural Approach: In-Memory Index with File-System-as-Truth

The core of the architecture is a dual approach:

1.  **In-Memory Index**: On startup, the server parses the entire documentation project and builds a lightweight, in-memory index of the document structure (files, sections, line numbers, includes). This index is the key to achieving the **Performance** goals (PERF-1), as it allows for near-instant lookups of content locations without repeatedly reading files from disk.

2.  **File System as the Single Source of Truth**: The system is stateless. The file system holds the definitive state of the documentation at all times. All modifications are written directly back to the source files. This approach satisfies the constraints of **Human-Readable Files** and **Version Control Integration**. It also simplifies the architecture by avoiding the need for a database (Constraint: **File-System Based**).

=== Technology Decisions

To implement this strategy, the following technology stack is proposed. The choices are guided by the need for strong text processing capabilities, a robust ecosystem, and fast development.

.Proposed Technology Stack
[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Component | Technology | Justification
| **Language** | **Python 3.12+** | Excellent for text processing, large standard library, strong community support, and mature libraries for parsing and web development.
| **Package Manager** | **uv** | Ultra-fast Python package installer and resolver. Provides deterministic builds via `uv.lock`, faster dependency resolution than pip/poetry, and integrated virtual environment management.
| **Web Server / API** | **FastAPI** | Provides a high-performance, MCP-compliant web server with automatic data validation and API documentation, directly supporting **Usability** (USAB-1, USAB-2).
| **MCP SDK** | **mcp[cli]** | Official MCP SDK for Python to ensure full protocol compliance.
| **Document Parsing** | **Custom Parser Logic** | A custom parser will be developed to handle AsciiDoc/Markdown specifics, especially the critical requirement of resolving includes and tracking line numbers accurately. Off-the-shelf libraries often lack the required granularity. This directly addresses the risk of **Format Variations**.
| **Diff Engine** | **difflib** | Python's standard library for generating diffs, sufficient for providing real-time feedback in the web UI (**Usability**, USAB-3).

=== Development Environment Setup

The project uses **uv** for Python environment and dependency management:

[source,bash]
----
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run dacli-mcp

# Add a new dependency
uv add <package-name>

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev <package-name>
----

The `pyproject.toml` defines all dependencies, and `uv.lock` ensures reproducible builds across all environments.

=== Achieving Key Quality Goals

The architectural strategy directly addresses the top quality goals defined in Chapter 10.

.Strategy-to-Quality-Goal Mapping
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Strategy | Quality Goal Addressed | How it is achieved
| **In-Memory Structure Index** | **Performance** (PERF-1, PERF-2) | Read operations query the fast in-memory index for file locations instead of parsing files on every request.
| **Atomic Write-Through Cache** | **Reliability** (REL-1, REL-3) | A File System Handler component implements atomic writes by using temporary files and backups. This prevents file corruption.
| **MCP-Compliant API (FastAPI)** | **Usability** (USAB-1) | FastAPI's strict schema validation and automatic documentation ensures the API adheres to the defined protocol.
| **Stateless, File-Based Design** | **Scalability** (SCAL-1) & **Reliability** | By keeping the server stateless, scaling becomes simpler (less state to manage). It also improves reliability as there is no complex database state to corrupt or manage.
