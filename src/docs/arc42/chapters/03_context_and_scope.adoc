== Context and Scope

This chapter describes the system's boundaries, its users, and its interactions with external systems.

=== Business Context

From a business perspective, dacli acts as a specialized middleware that enables technical users to interact with documentation projects more effectively. It abstracts away the complexity of file-based document structures and provides both a CLI for direct use and an MCP server for LLM integration.

=== Technical Context

On a technical level, the MCP server is spawned as a subprocess by an MCP-compliant client and communicates via stdio (standard input/output). The CLI tool can be invoked directly from the shell. Both interfaces interact directly with the file system to read documentation source files and write back modifications.
